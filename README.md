Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Guide
1. Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data analysis where the main objective is to understand the underlying patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses. This guide outlines the common practices and methods for conducting EDA.

2. Data Understanding
Load the Data: Import the necessary libraries and load your dataset.
Inspect the Data: Use methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe() to get an overview of the dataset.
3. Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values:

Identify missing values using .isnull().sum().
Decide on strategies for handling missing values (removal, imputation).
Remove Duplicates: Check for duplicate rows using .duplicated() and remove them if necessary.

Fix Data Types: Ensure each column has the appropriate data type (e.g., convert strings to datetime).

4. Data Visualization
Visualizations are crucial in EDA to illustrate patterns and relationships.

Univariate Analysis:

Histograms: Use sns.histplot() or plt.hist() to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
Box Plots: Use sns.boxplot() to identify outliers and visualize the spread of the data.
Bivariate Analysis:

Scatter Plots: Use sns.scatterplot() to explore relationships between two numerical variables.
Bar Plots: Use sns.barplot() for categorical variables to show counts or means.
Heatmaps: Use sns.heatmap() to visualize correlations between numerical features.
Multivariate Analysis: Explore interactions between more than two variables using pair plots or facet grids.

5. Summary Statistics
Generate summary statistics for numerical features using df.describe().
Calculate correlations among numerical features using df.corr().
6. Findings and Insights
Summarize the insights gained from your analysis:

Highlight any interesting trends, anomalies, or relationships discovered.
Discuss potential factors that could influence your target variable.
7. Conclusion
Conclude the EDA by summarizing the overall findings.
Suggest further analysis or next steps, such as feature engineering or modeling.
